EN: If you're interested in my resume, [here](https://github.com/pooky1955/pooky1955/blob/main/James%20Liang%20CV.pdf) it is! 
#### About Me
I'm an aspiring machine learning research engineer, and I love programming, machine learning, and deep learning. I'm currently a first-year student at McGill University in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science.
#### Experiences
Previously, I interned at Boehringer Ingelheim as a data scientist for two years, developing data-driven solutions for clinical trials and email send times.
Additionally, I also work as a software developer at LabTNS/University of Montreal, developing [OCRx](https://ocrx.ca), a Canadian ontology.



#### Projects
Some of the projects I'm proud of include
- My [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYBfGYBuGvgM-gVU5bcfq2A) Channel: Pooky Codes, where I explain topics such as machine learning, the mathematics behind neural networks, and funny skits! (Repository available [here](https://github.com/pooky1955/pooky-coders-yt))
- [iNews](https://github.com/pooky1955/iNews): a fake news detector using a state-of-the-art stance detection model and scrapes multiple websites to verify the credibility of the source and check for existing fake news articles on it.
- [Summarize and Ask](https://github.com/pooky1955/summarize-and-ask): A simple website made under 24 hours using Streamlit and MobileBERTSUM as well as BERT to both summarize and answer any questions of any text.
- [Connect 4 AI](https://github.com/pooky1955/connect4AI): This was one of my very first projects and was inspired by Alphago's Monte Carlo Tree Search. Monte Carlo Tree Search was used to implement a superhuman connect4 AI bot.
- [Inspiratiq](https://github.com/pooky1955/inspiratiq-shop): One of the websites I made for my sister's shop! It was made using Gatsby, Stripe, as well as React. Visit it [here](https://inspiratiq.com)
